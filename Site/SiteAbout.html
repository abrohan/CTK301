<p class="aboutpara">I am a college student currently at Illinois State University. I am majoring in Game Design under the Creative Arts and Technology course. All my life I have been fascinated with video games and would like to pursue my career in Game Design to one day make one of my own. It is going to take a lot of work, and CTK is a step towards that goal.</p>

<p class="aboutpara">This website is to compile everything that I learned in the CTK 301 course across the Spring 2021 semester. I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Adobe XD throughout this semester. I enjoyed what I have learned and can't wait to continue to grow as I further my learning opportunities</p>

<p class="aboutpara">I hope what you find here interests you, and thank you for taking a look at what I have learned. If you want to contact me my Illinois State email is below.</p>
